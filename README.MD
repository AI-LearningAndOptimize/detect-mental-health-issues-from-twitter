### Happyness Analysis

Simple test of relevant research using twitter to detect mental issues using twitter messages.

The Happyness Analysis notebook is an inital attempt to use the conclusions of the following study:

* Forecasting the onset and course of mental illness with Twitter data (Harvard 2018)  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07740.pdf

There are two notebooks:
* `happyness-analysis` represents the complete cycle (1. download relevant twees; 2. Sentiment Analysis; Happyness Analysis)
* `happyness-analysis-FromFile` represents the cycle using tweets saved on file (1. read relevant twees; 2. Sentiment Analysis; Happyness Analysis)


It is a very simple attempt that uses tweets referring to DWP and Jobcentre to measure Sentiment & Happiness of some users.


This is the result of an Hackathon (of sort) organised by the DWP in Leeds (22/03/2019), presented as the results of team `Wall-E`.

There are a number of interesting studies on the subject of using social media (including instagram!) to detect signs of mental issues:
